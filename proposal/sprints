Sprint Schedule 
Our team will follow the Scrum approach when developing projects. We will create a sprint backlog, about every 7 days for sprint review. We will also use Jira to track tasks during each sprint and update the code on GitHub.
Stand-up Meetings 
Since some members are in Australia and some members are in China, we cannot meet in person so we would like to have online meeting on Zoom.
