/**  Project Diary for Yangyu GAO  **/
-- Week 1 2020/06/07 Sunday --
This is the first week of the semester 2, we create a group and named it Orchid Malevolence, an insignificant name but sounds cool for me. 

Our group have 5 members, all of us are from China, which means we do not have problem in communication. 

Before the tutorial, we met together online and try to filter some projects which we really want to avoid. Then we prepared some questions to ask during the tutorial time.

We all choose friday's tutorial, Xin Li made a great tutorial class and told us to make a decision on which topic to choose, and vote a scrum master. By discussing for a while, we finally choose ReadRecommend as our project subject. After that, we voted Yuwei Zhuge as our scrum master.


After the tutorial, I create a github repository, and invite all my group members. In addition, I create a Jira project by following the document in webcms3.

On Saturday, I read the requirement very carefully and transfered the document into ordering informations. Then I provided this document to my partners. Then we met online and talked about next weeks's plan. We are going to draw the system flow chart through the requirement.

Finnaly, my job is to do the front end, and we finally decide to use Vue as our front end language. So I have started to learn Vue this week.
