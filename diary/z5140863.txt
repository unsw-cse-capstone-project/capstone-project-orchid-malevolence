I and YangYu Gao and YaoDong Wang are responsible for front-end development. 
We decide to use js, Vue framework to build the user interface. 
In the the next week, we plan to complete part of the Proposal, and i plan to find learning materials about Vue.

week2
I and YangYu Gao and YaoDong Wang discussed the general functionality to be implemented on each page and completed the System Flow section. 
After discussion, we determined the rest of the Proposal that everyone would write. 
We will finish the Proposal next week. The front group has also started to write the login screen.

week3
We completed the proposal.
I was mainly responsible for the background part and the part of “out of scope”. 
And i made a small modification of system-flow at the same time. 
As the knowledge about Vue is not comprehensive enough, I will mainly learn Vue related things and start coding next week.

week4
I finished the front-end functions of the login and registration interface. 
And I will continue to improve the page next week.
