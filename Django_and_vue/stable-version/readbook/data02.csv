It is often the case, though, that a trial and error approach is applied to the development of new products and processes, rather than verified scientific principles. The purpose of this book is to describe the features of unit operations used in confectionary manufacturing. In contrast to the common technology-focused approach to this subject, this volume offers a scientific, theoretical account of confectionery manufacture, building on the scientific background of chemical engineering. The large diversity of both raw materials and end products in the confectionery industry makes it beneficial to approach the subject in this way. The industry deals with a variety of vegetable based raw materials as well as milk products, eggs, gelatin, and other animal-based raw materials. A study of confectionery and chocolate engineering must therefore examine the physical and chemical, as well as the biochemical and microbiological properties of the processed materials. By characterizing the unit operations of confectionery manufacture the author, who has over 40 years’ experience in confectionery manufacture, aims to open up new possibilities for improvement relating to increased efficiency of operations, the use of new materials, and new applications for traditional raw materials. The book is aimed at food engineers, scientists, technologists in research and industry, as well as graduate students on relevant food and chemical engineering-related courses."

The material concentrates on fundamental theories as well as techniques and algorithms. The advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and, more recently, the emergence of cloud computing and streaming data applications, has forced a renewal of interest in distributed and parallel data management, while, at the same time, requiring a rethinking of some of the traditional techniques. This book covers the breadth and depth of this re-emerging field. The coverage consists of two parts. The first part discusses the fundamental principles of distributed data management and includes distribution design, data integration, distributed query processing and optimization, distributed transaction management, and replication. The second part focuses on more advanced topics and includes discussion of parallel database systems, distributed object management, peer-to-peer data management, web data management, data stream systems, and cloud computing. New in this Edition: • New chapters, covering database replication, database integration, multidatabase query processing, peer-to-peer data management, and web data management. • Coverage of emerging topics such as data streams and cloud computing • Extensive revisions and updates based on years of class testing and feedback Ancillary teaching materials are available."

By the time the Bundy Manufacturing Company relocated to Endicott, New York, it was part of the greatest industrial revolution in the world: the birth of computing technology. IBM in Endicott illustrates the development of a corporation and the people and ideas that made IBM a household word. With the city of Endicott at the epicenter of progress, IBM grew from a small company named Bundy Manufacturing, incorporated in 1889, to the company known as International Business Machines.

These short lived optical emissions in the mesosphere can reach from the tops of thunderclouds up to the ionosphere; they provide direct evidence of coupling from the lower atmosphere to the upper atmosphere. Sprites are arguably the most dramatic recent discovery in solar-terrestrial physics. Shortly after the first ground based video recordings of sprites, observations on board the Space Shuttle detected sprites and elves occurring all around the world. These reports led to detailed sprite observations in North America, South America, Australia, Japan, and Europe. Subsequently, sprites were detected from other space platforms such as the International Space Station and the ROCSAT satellite. During the past 15 years, more than 200 contributions on sprites have been published in the scientific literature to document this rapidly evolving new research area."

This is a time of desperation for the good races because Darius has been lost to lower Neoluzia due to the Gathering of Replenishment spell cast upon him by members of the secretive wizard guild, the Veiled Institution. David Parr, a human from Earth summoned by Darius that reluctantly remains in Neoluzia to assist the Salon of Enlightenment against their Orc enemies, must find the great necromancer Termaplix if the land is to be saved. Finding Termaplix may be impossible however, for the hero from the War of Cleansing has been hidden in a secret place due to unknown circumstances one thousand years ago--a tomb long since forgotten to the current generations in the land. Perilously stifled in their shift away from the old magic and the forced elimination of history, those that Parr seeks to help against the enemy from the north must first learn to embrace the gift of magic again, an art banished in antiquity by the deception of peace and the deep wounds of the surviving populations in the first war."

In many states, UST owners, operators, contractors, and inspectors must prove that they understand how to apply a vast and growing body of technical and legal specifications to their work. Technology of Underground Liquid Storage Tank Systems is based on John Hartmann's celebrated training course at the University of Wisconsin-Madison--the longest-running, most well-attended course of its kind. It was written for busy engineers, contractors, owner/operators, and inspectors who need to come up to speed on both the technology and the regulatory requirements involved in designing, installing, and closing USTs. This complete, practical guide covers all the bases, from site assessment to damage control, regulatory compliance and legal considerations to project management. Drawing upon his 35 years of experience as a UST contractor and consultant, as well as the experience of several other leading experts in the field, Mr. Hartmann provides careful, step-by-step guidance and a gold mine of practical advice on how to avoid most technical and legal snags commonly encountered in building, maintaining, or removing USTs."

This interim report evaluates storage facilities at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, with a particular focus on plans to seal the tanks with grouting. The report finds that tanks at the site do not necessarily need to be sealed shut as soon as the bulk of the waste has been removed. Postponing permanent closure buys more time for the development and application of emerging technologies to remove and better immobilize residual waste, without increasing risks to the environment or delaying final closure of the ""tank farms."" The report also recommends alternatives to address the lack of tank space at the site, as well as the need for focused R&D activities to reduce the amount and improve the immobilization of residual waste in the tanks and to test some of the assumptions used in evaulating long-term risks at the site."

DOE plans to remove the waste from the tanks, separate out high-level radioactive waste to be shipped to an off-site geological repository, and dispose of the remaining lower-activity waste onsite. The report concludes that DOEâ€™s overall plan is workable, but some important challenges must be overcomeâ€""including the removal of residual waste from some tanks, especially at Hanford and Savannah River.

The audience enters a world of limbo through Stuart's altered state: a land where people who attempt suicide have to go before their time to ""really"" die arrives. The rules here are that you can't eat, sleep, cry, love or be loved, but all of these yearnings seem to intensify during your stay in this ""world."" In addition, all wounds associated with the suicidal act never heal. Stuart is greeted by Daniel, B.J. and Muggy, who take great joy in being the welcoming committee. But what really gets Stuart thinking is when he runs into Lisa, an old crush and former prom queen at his school who committed suicide shortly before his attempt. Through their humorous and honest interactions, we begin to understand and realize a better appreciation for life. When Stuart's little sister comes to visit him at the hospital, Stuart discovers that the time has come for him to decide whether he wants to live or die. Pizza With Shrimp on Top is about many things besides the obvious message of, ""Hey, don't kill yourself."" It stresses the importance of not taking yourself too seriously and emphasizes the value of communication, appreciating loved ones, and a teenager's belief in himself or herself during this difficult developmental period in life. Pizza has been seen by several thousand teenagers, parents, and other community members who have been deeply affected by this powerful piece of theater.""--Publisher's website."

Now Carol Helstosky documents the fascinating history and cultural life of this chameleon-like food in Pizza. Originally a food for the poor in eighteenth-century Naples, the pizza is a source of national and regional pride as well as cultural identity in Italy, Helstosky reveals. In the twentieth century, the pizza followed Italian immigrants to America, where it became the nation’s most popular dish and fueled the rise of successful fast-food corporations such as Pizza Hut and Domino’s. Along the way, Helstosky explains, pizza has been adapted to local cuisines and has become a metaphor for cultural exchange. Pizza also features several recipes and a wealth of illustrations, including a photo of the world’s largest and most expensive pizza—sprinkled with edible 24-karat gold shavings and costing over $4000. Whether you love sausage and onions on your pizza or unadorned cheese, Pizza has enough offerings to satiate even the pickiest of readers."

Readers at all levels can continue to deepen their understanding of this rich tale about the Lover and his quest--against the admonishments of Reason and the obstacles set by Jealousy and Resistance--to pluck the fair Rose in the Enchanted Garden. The original introduction by Dahlberg remains an excellent overview of the work, covering such topics as the iconographic significance of the imagery and the use of irony in developing the central theme of love. His new preface reviews selected scholarship through 1990, which examines, for example, the sources and influences of the work, the two authors, the nature of the allegorical narrative as a genre, the use of first person, and the poem's early reception. The new bibliographic material incorporates that of the earlier editions.

A review of the history of shark fisheries demonstrates that intensive shark fisheries are not sustainable. Numerous problems are encountered in assessing shark populations: a general lack of biological and fishery data, lack of suitable models, and lack of validated age estimates. Sharks have an unusual combination of biological characteristics: slow growth and delayed maturation, long reproductive cycles, low fecundity and long life spans. These characteristics make them vulnerable to overfishing. A preliminary evaluation of the status of shark species is made on the basis of historical data, the reproductive potential of each species, and the level of exploitation of the species. In this document, exploited shark species are classified numerically according to their vulnerability. The majority of these species are listed as Category 1, indicating that there are not sufficient data to assess the species. Available data indicate that sharks are very vulnerable and are threatened by overexploitation in many parts of the world."

It was a ruthless imperial city, with a shrewd commercial base, like ancient Athens, which it resembled in its combination of art and sea empire. Venice: Lion City presents a new way of relating the history of the city through its art and, in turn, illuminates the art through the city's history. It is illustrated with more than 130 works of art, 30 in full color. Garry Wills gives us a unique view of Venice's rulers, merchants, clerics, laborers, its Jews, and its women as they created a city that is the greatest art museum in the world, a city whose allure remains undiminished after centuries. Like Simon Schama's The Embarrassment of Riches, on the Dutch culture in the Golden Age, Venice: Lion City will take its place as a classic work of history and criticism."

Years later, Saroo met students from India at his college in Canberra and embarked on what appeared an impossible search for his childhood town. He began to piece together the bits he had carefully memorized, poring over satellite images in Google Earth. Eventually, twenty-five years after he had got lost, Saroo was able to trace his home town to Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, where he set off to look for his mother. Lion is an inspiring true story of the power of hope and what the human will can achieve in the face of insurmountable odds."

In addition, multi-core processors are expected to place ever higher bandwidth demands on the memory system. All these issues make it important to avoid off-chip memory access by improving the efficiency of the on-chip cache. Future multi-core processors will have many large cache banks connected by a network and shared by many cores. Hence, many important problems must be solved: cache resources must be allocated across many cores, data must be placed in cache banks that are near the accessing core, and the most important data must be identified for retention. Finally, difficulties in scaling existing technologies require adapting to and exploiting new technology constraints. The book attempts a synthesis of recent cache research that has focused on innovations for multi-core processors. It is an excellent starting point for early-stage graduate students, researchers, and practitioners who wish to understand the landscape of recent cache research. The book is suitable as a reference for advanced computer architecture classes as well as for experienced researchers and VLSI engineers.

Over the next millennia, deposition buried the cache several meters below the surface. The entombed artifacts lay undisturbed until 2003. A circuitous path brought thirteen of the original thirty-seven Clovis bifaces and points through many hands before reaching the attention of Michael Waters at Texas A&M University. At the site of the original cache, Waters and coauthor Thomas A. Jennings conducted excavations, studied the geology, and dated the geological layers to reconstruct how the cache was buried. This book provides a well-illustrated, thoroughly analyzed description and discussion of the Hogeye Clovis cache, the projectile points and other artifacts from later occupations, and the geological context of the site, which has yielded evidence of multiple Paleoindian, Archaic, and Late Prehistoric occupations. The cache of tools and weapons at Hogeye, when combined with other sites, allows us to envision a snapshot of life at the end of the last Ice Age."

The book targets game developers, graphics programmers, and also students with some basic understanding of computer graphics algorithms, rendering APIs like Direct3D or OpenGL, and shader programming. In order to make the book self-contained, the most important concepts of local illumination and global illumination rendering, graphics hardware, and Direct3D/HLSL programming are reviewed in the first chapters. After these introductory chapters we warm up with simple methods including shadow and environment mapping, then we move on toward advanced concepts aiming at global illumination rendering. Since it would have been impossible to give a rigorous review of all approaches proposed in this field, we go into the details of just a few methods solving each particular global illumination effect. However, a short discussion of the state of the art and links to the bibliography are also provided to refer the interested reader to techniques that are not detailed in this book. The implementation of the selected methods is also presented in HLSL, and we discuss their observed performance, merits, and disadvantages. In the last chapter, we also review how these techniques can be integrated in an advanced game engine and present case studies of their exploitation in games. Having gone through this book, the reader will have an overview of the state of the art, will be able to apply and improve these techniques, and most importantly, will be capable of developing brand new GPU algorithms.

This often demands that MATLAB codes run faster by leveraging the distributed parallelism of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). While MATLAB successfully provides high-level functions as a simulation tool for rapid prototyping, the underlying details and knowledge needed for utilizing GPUs make MATLAB users hesitate to step into it. Accelerating MATLAB with GPUs offers a primer on bridging this gap. Starting with the basics, setting up MATLAB for CUDA (in Windows, Linux and Mac OS X) and profiling, it then guides users through advanced topics such as CUDA libraries. The authors share their experience developing algorithms using MATLAB, C++ and GPUs for huge datasets, modifying MATLAB codes to better utilize the computational power of GPUs, and integrating them into commercial software products. Throughout the book, they demonstrate many example codes that can be used as templates of C-MEX and CUDA codes for readers’ projects.

In effect, not only the individual business models but also the overall industry competitive model has changed. No longer confined to serving a physically defined environment, individual newspapers can set their own goals, both for news distribution and for advertising reach, without concern for physical restrictions. And the continual sales of newspaper properties result in mergers, increased clustering and other types of group alliances. The newspaper industry is also affected competitively by employee recruitment and retention, the non-daily market, other news-related media and non-news carriers of advertising. The industry-related technology has in effect exploded, reaching every news medium in some way. Within the framework of the exploding technological environment, the country's economy and changing demographics have created increased challenges for an industry so dependent on advertising revenue and reader reach.

CENE, the Corpus of English Newspaper Editorials, was compiled for the purposes of this study and comprises editorials from the Daily Telegraph, the Guardian, and The Times chosen to represent periods at ten-year intervals. The language of the editorials was investigated with regard to features that previous research had proved to be markers of such types of discourse as might be of interest to an investigation of the development of the language of newspaper editorials. To begin with, sets of features associated with the empirically defined dimensions of linguistic variation presented in Biber (1988) were compared across decades and newspapers; these dimensions included personal involvement and information density, narrative discourse, argumentative discourse, abstract discourse, and explicit reference. However, since the study showed that the features within each set often developed in diverging directions, the old sets were broken up and new ones formed on the basis of change and continuity as well as of shared linguistic/stylistic functions, specific for newspaper editorials, among the features involved. It then became apparent that, during the 20th century, the language of the editorials developed towards greater information density and lexical specificity and diversity but at the same time towards greater informality, in so far as the use of conversational features increased. The narrative quality of the editorials at the beginning of the century gradually decreased whereas their reporting and argumentative functions remained the same over the years. When the features were compared across the newspapers analyzed, a clear distinction was noticed between The Times and the Guardian. The language of the Guardian was the most informal and the most narrative while that of The Times was the least so. The information density was the highest inThe Times and the lowest in the Guardian. In these respects, the Daily Telegraph took an intermediate position. The editorials of the Guardian were more argumentative than those of both the Daily Telegraph and The Times. As regards lexical specificity and diversity as well as sentence complexity, the Daily Telegraph scored the highest and The Times the lowest while the results obtained for the Guardian were in between the two."

Though it is aimed at journalism students enrolled in newspaper management classes, it is also worthwhile reading for the curious reporter or copy editor who knows little about how newspapers make and spend money. . . . The book is sprinkled with good, common sense about balancing newspapers as a business against newspapering as good journalism. Professor Willis makes a gallant attempt to make sure students understand that though the newspaper must make a profit to survive, it will never truly excel unless it produces a good news-editorial product. ASNE Bulletin Surviving in the Newspaper Business is a how-to-do-it guide to newspaper management for the 1980s and beyond. It presents a set of unified principles for successful management and exposes the student to the primary mission of the newspaper: to deliver a quality product to the depth and breadth of the marketplace.

Uwakah is concerned about the abuse of this important fundamental right in his country. The purpose of the book is to examine how due process operates in Nigeria and whether the coexistence of the customary law, the English common law, the Moslem law, and the martial law systems in Nigeria hinders or enhances due process in the country. Finally, the study investigates the suitability of the British version of due process to Nigeria, since the concept is imported to the country. The book concludes that the British version of due process is unsuitable to Nigeria because the country's political, economic, social, and religious backgrounds substantially differ from those of Britain. This conclusion is premised on the consensus of the interviewees. Uwakah recommends the country's immediate transition from military to civilian rule."

The author demonstrates the potential of international law in protecting the rights of children, even in states which are restructuring their economies. To be effective, international law cannot be used in isolation and the text seeks to place the rights of the child in their cultural and historical contexts.

How can ancient Eastern wisdom traditions, such as Taoism and Zen Buddhism, improve our jump-shots? What can the “Zen Master” (Phil Jackson) and the “Big Aristotle” (Shaquille O’Neal) teach us about sustained excellence and success? Is women’s basketball “better” basketball? How, ethically, should one deal with a strategic cheater in pickup basketball? With NBA and NCAA team rosters constantly changing, what does it mean to play for the “same team”? What can coaching legends Dean Smith, Rick Pitino, Pat Summitt, and Mike Krzyzewski teach us about character, achievement, and competition? What makes basketball such a beautiful game to watch and play? Basketball is now the most popular team sport in the United States; each year, more than 50 million Americans attend college and pro basketball games. When Dr. James Naismith, the inventor of basketball, first nailed two peach baskets at the opposite ends of a Springfield, Massachusetts, gym in 1891, he had little idea of how thoroughly the game would shape American—and international—culture. Hoops superstars such as Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Yao Ming are now instantly recognized celebrities all across the planet. So what can a group of philosophers add to the understanding of basketball? It is a relatively simple game, but as Kant and Dennis Rodman liked to say, appearances can be deceiving. Coach Phil Jackson actively uses philosophy to improve player performance and to motivate and inspire his team and his fellow coaches, both on and off the court. Jackson has integrated philosophy into his coaching and his personal life so thoroughly that it is often difficult to distinguish his role as a basketball coach from his role as a philosophical guide and mentor to his players. In Basketball and Philosophy, a Dream Team of twenty-six basketball fans, most of whom also happen to be philosophers, proves that basketball is the thinking person’s sport. They look at what happens when the Tao meets the hardwood as they explore the teamwork, patience, selflessness, and balanced and harmonious action that make up the art of playing basketball."

In spite of the efforts made and resources invested over the past decades, football hooliganism is still perceived by politicians, policymakers and media as a disturbing social problem. This highly readable book provides the first systematic and empirically grounded comparison of football hooliganism in different national and local contexts. Focused around the six Western European football clubs on which the author did his research, the book shows how different clubs experience and understand football hooliganism in different ways. The development and effects of anti-hooligan policies are also assessed.

He was widely viewed as the ablest football scout of his time and coached at the U.S. Naval Academy for 33 years; his son is New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, a three-time Super Bowl winner. When Steve Belichick died in November 2005, the New York Times headline cited him as ""Coach Who Wrote the Book on Scouting,"" and quoted Houston Texans General Manager Charley Casserly calling Football Scouting Methods ""the best book on scouting he had ever read."" Joe Bellino, Navy's Heisman Trophy winner in 1960, told the Times that Steve Belichick ""was a genius. On Monday nights, he would give us his scouting reports, and even though we were playing powerhouses, I always felt we were prepared because he found a way for us to win."" In recent years Football Scouting Methods has been one of the top ten most sought out-of-print books; used copies have been quite scarce. This reissue edition makes the original 1962 text available once again in exact facsimile. The book covers how to scout opponents, recognize defenses, analyze offenses, discover ""tip-offs"" that reveal the opponent's plays, compose a useful report, self-scout, and conduct postgame analysis. ""Steve Belichick taught many younger men how to scout and how to watch film and how to prepare their teams for the next week's game,"" David Halberstam noted in the Washington Post, and his best student was his own son Bill Belichick, ""one of whose greatest skills as a coach to this day remains his ability to analyze other teams, figuring out both their strengths and their vulnerabilities, and shrewdly deciding how to take away from them that which they most want to do."" When CBS asked Bill Belichick to name his favorite book, he replied ""Well, I've got to go with my dad's. Football Scouting Methods. I'd have to go with that."""

Is it a game of skill, a test of manhood, or merely an organized brawl? Michael Oriard, a former professional player, asks these and other intriguing questions in Reading Football, the first contemporary book about football's formative years. American football began in the 1870s as a game to be played, not watched. Within a brief ten years, it had become a great public spectacle with an immense following, a phenomenon caused primarily by the voluminous commentary about the game conducted in popular newspapers and magazines. Oriard shows how this constant narrative in football's early years developed many different stories about what the game meant: football as pastime, as the sport of gentlemen, as a science, as a game of rules and their infringements. He shows how football became a series of cultural stories about power, luck, strategy, and deception. These different interpretations have been magnified by football's current omnipresence on television. According to Oriard, televised football now plays a cultural role of enormous importance for men, yet within the field of cultural studies the influence of football has been ignored until now."
